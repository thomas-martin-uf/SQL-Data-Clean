# SQL-Data-Clean
## Overview
This project is a solution to a practical question aimed at demonstrating the process of transforming real-world data from a CSV format into SQL insert commands. The task involves cleaning and restructuring the CSV data and preparing it for upload into an SQL table. The code presented is used to clean the data to generate valid sql insert commands that are then written to a file and can be used for bulk insertion into an Oracle database.

## Task Description
- Table Schema Creation: Create an SQL table schema named ToyCarOrdersAndSales with predefined fields.
- Data Download: Download the dataset from Kaggle and extract the CSV file.
- Data Transformation: Transform the CSV file into an SQL script (ToyCarOrdersAndSales Insert Commands.sql) containing SQL insert commands for each record.
- Data Upload: Execute the generated SQL insert commands in Oracle SQL Developer and verify the insertion of rows.
- Data Query: Write SQL queries to retrieve tuples from the table and provide screenshots of the results.
